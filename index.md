# HR Analytics.

HR analytics is a data-driven approach to managing people at work. WI business leaders can make decisions about their people based on deep analysis of data rather than the traditional methods of personal relationships, decision making based on experience, and risk avoidance. We help you understand how and when hard data is used to make soft-skill decisions about hiring and talent development, so that you can position yourself as a strategic partner in your companyâ€™s talent management decisions.
